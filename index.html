    <h1>My Vacation</h1>

    <h2>Day 1: Arrival</h2>
    <p>
      I arrived at my hotel in the afternoon and checked in. The room was
      spacious and had a great view of the ocean.
    </p>
    <h2>Day 2: Beach Day</h2>
    <p>
      I spent the whole day at the beach, soaking up the sun and swimming in the
      ocean. The water was warm and clear.
    </p>
    <h3>Beach Volleyball</h3>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, I played beach volleyball with some other tourists. It
      was a lot of fun, but also quite tiring!
    </p>
    <h2>Day 3: Exploring</h2>
    <p>
      On the third day, I rented a bike and went exploring. I visited some local
      markets and tried some delicious food.

    <h4>Local Market</h4>

    <p>
      The market was crowded and noisy, but it was worth it for the amazing
      food. I tried some fresh fruit, grilled meat, and seafood.
    </p>
    <h5>Seafood</h5>
    <p>
      The seafood was especially good. I had some grilled fish with lemon and
      herbs, and it was so tasty.
    </p>
    <h2>Day 4: Relaxation</h2>
    <p>
      On the last day of my vacation, I just relaxed by the pool and read a
      book. It was a nice way to end the trip.
    </p>
    <h6>Goodbye</h6>
    <p>
      After four days of sun, sand, and relaxation, it was time to say goodbye
      to the beach and head back home.
